# **Creating a new Repo**

## Overview

This is a simple guideline that is intended to help us create consistent Repo's within the OpenHW Group GitHub project.  

The guideline specifies how to set up a new Repo and assign Committers.

## Process

1. In the root directory of the OpenHW Group GitHub project, press the create new repo button: ![image-20200507130756048](C:\Users\FET-laptop\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200507130756048.png)
2. **Repo Name:** You will be prompted for a repo name: Enter something meaningful: typically something that makes it clear which task group the repo is associated with.
3. **Description**:  Add a description so that new members to OpenHW Group can navigate to the task group repo's that are of most interest.
4. **Public/Private Repo's**:  Select Public repo so that anyone can see what we are doing.
5. **README File**:  Choose to initialize the repo with a README File.  This will further help new members understand what the task group repo is about.  
   1. It should begin with:  *"**If you have not already, please have a look at the [OpenHW Group's website](https://www.openhwgroup.org) to learn a bit more about who we are and what we are doing**.*"  
   2. It should then direct folks to read the **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - see below.
   3. Then add some text that describes the purpose of the repo.
6. **Ignore files**:   Add .gitignore:None   (Unless you have specific file types you would like GitHub to ignore)
7. **Add a license:**  Eclipse Public License 2.0   or SolderPad - I need help here.  . . . . 
8. **Press** the ![image-20200507132505365](C:\Users\FET-laptop\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200507132505365.png)button.
9. **Include** the **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** document to the repo.
10. Include the **Meeting Minutes Template.md** document to the repo.
11. **Assigning Committers:**  Within the repo, under the **Settings** tab, select the **Manage access** left hand menu item.  Press the ![image-20200507132914786](C:\Users\FET-laptop\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200507132914786.png)and navigate to the individuals who should have committer status. This is usually limited to the Chairs of a task group or employees of the OpenHW Group.
